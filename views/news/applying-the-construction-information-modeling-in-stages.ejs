                                          <p>The summary of the implementation of Decision No. 2500/QD-TTg dated December 22, 2016, approved by the
                                            Prime Minister on the application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in construction activities and
                                            the results of monitoring the application of BIM by the Ministry of Construction in the period of
                                            2017-2021 show that applying BIM helps shorten the time and improve the quality of design, construction,
                                            and project management.</p>
                                          <p>Mr. Nguyen Thai Binh, Editor-in-Chief of Construction Magazine, said that based on this practical
                                            effectiveness, at the request of the Ministry of Construction, on March 17, 2023, the Prime Minister
                                            issued Decision No. 258/QD-TTg approving the roadmap for applying BIM in construction activities,
                                            requiring the application of BIM for new construction investment projects using public investment
                                            capital, foreign state investment capital, and investment under the public-private partnership method.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>The government regulates the implementation of BIM in stages. In which, stage 1 will be implemented
                                            from 2023, with mandatory application of BIM for Grade I and special-grade construction works of new
                                            investment projects using public investment capital, foreign state investment capital, and investment
                                            under the public-private partnership method starting to carry out project preparation tasks.</p>
                                          <p>Stage 2 will be implemented from 2025, with mandatory application of BIM for Grade II and above
                                            construction works of new investment projects using public investment capital, foreign state investment
                                            capital, and investment under the public-private partnership method starting to carry out project
                                            preparation tasks, Mr. Binh informed.</p>
                            
                                          <p>Participating in the National BIM Pilot Program for the Can Tho Central Orthopedic Hospital Project,
                                            Mr. Pham Phu Duc - Deputy Director of Danang Construction Designing & Consultancy Joint
                                            Stock Company (CDC DANANG) shared that the overall design and consultancy contractor plays a very
                                            important role in
                                            the BIM process. They are often placed in the highest position among contractors participating in the
                                            BIM process, with responsibilities to propose BIM deployment plans, manage and coordinate the activities
                                            of related parties in the process.</p>
                                          <p>Sharing experience on the BIM application roadmap of a Japanese company in Singapore, Mr. Pham Truong
                                            Giang - Head of BIM & Engineering, Shimizu Vietnam said that in order to adapt to the BIM application in
                                            compliance with the roadmap and requirements of the Singaporean government, Shimizu's international
                                            office has established its own roadmap consisting of 3 stages. Currently, the application of BIM by the
                                            Shimizu Group through the BIM Committee has been shared and applied to all branches of the Group as an
                                            affirmation of its usefulness and necessity.</p>
                                          <p>Mr. Hoang Hiep - Deputy General Director of Portcoast Consultant Corporation (PORTCOAST) evaluates BIM
                                            as a digital representation of the characteristics and functions of the project; it is a reliable and
                                            unique source of information and knowledge shared among all units participating in the project, forming
                                            a reliable basis for decisions throughout the project's life cycle from formation to dismantlement.
                                            Creating a construction information model will bring many benefits to the project, creating a huge
                                            amount of information leading to requirements for storage and the ability to use that data.</p>
                                          <p>From a business perspective, Mr. Do The Anh - Head of BIM Department at Xuan Mai Corporation asserts
                                            that in the precast concrete production industry, BIM has many useful applications such as optimizing
                                            production, controlling the production process, increasing synchronization, and improving construction
                                            productivity.</p>
                                          <p>Xuan Mai Corp has been using BIM technology to optimize the entire construction process from design,
                                            production to construction since 2014. Xuan Mai has applied BIM to implement design documents, control
                                            conflicts and collisions, coordinate multidisciplinary 3D to enhance visuality, and better control the
                                            design plan. This helps minimize conflicts in the production and construction process.</p>
                                          <p>In addition, Xuan Mai has built its own common BIM exchange management system (CDE) to facilitate the
                                            application of BIM in the production, construction, and coordination management phase. This system has
                                            become the data platform for digitizing Xuan Mai's work processes, helping to manage effectively, save
                                            costs, and human resources...</p>

                                          <p>From a professional perspective, Mr. Nguyen Pham Quang Tu - Deputy Director of the Institute of
                                            Construction Economics said that the requirement for applying BIM is to improve productivity, quality,
                                            and competitive capacity of the construction industry, and promote digital transformation. </p>
                                          <p>However, according to Mr. Tu, there are some challenges that need to be addressed, such as insufficient
                                            policy mechanisms related to BIM application, lack of core software domestically, challenges in
                                            information security, incomplete guidelines and standards, and lack of BIM human resources.</p>
                                          <p>Regarding the prospects for BIM development in Vietnam, Ms. Truong Thuy Linh - Head of Architecture and
                                            Construction Development at Autodesk Asia Pte Ltd believes that there are still some challenges ahead.
                                            Specifically, the current practice of working on 2D is still quite common in the construction industry,
                                            and the skills of BIM human resources also need to be improved. In addition, standards and legal
                                            guidelines need to be revised to support faster and more systematic business operations.</p>
                                          <p>Ms. Truong Thuy Linh proposed that ministries and sectors should support the application of BIM in
                                            publicly invested projects under Government Decision No. 258, coordinate inter-ministerially to provide
                                            detailed guidance and legal framework for BIM documents, and improve awareness of approving and
                                            controlling BIM projects in related ministries and sectors.</p>
                                          <p>In addition, academic institutions need to innovate in updating their student training programs and
                                            providing human resources to meet market demand. They should also connect and collaborate with
                                            businesses to develop technology from research, learning to practical application.</p>
                                          <p>Furthermore, experts believe that to effectively apply BIM, each unit needs to determine three
                                            important factors: personnel (100%), processes (60%), and tools (40%), with people being the key factor
                                            in the transformation process, especially in important roles. However, the barriers that the human
                                            factor needs to improve and overcome are mindset, perception, and teamwork.</p>
                                          <p>Not only experts in the industry, but also businesses expect that the application of BIM will bring a
                                            broader, more modern, and sustainable vision and future for the construction industry.</p>
