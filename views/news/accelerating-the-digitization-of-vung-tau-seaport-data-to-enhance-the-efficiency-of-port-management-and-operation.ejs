                                            10,000 DWT ships), it has been recognized that the world's Smart Port model,
                                            along with its Digital Twin, has been effectively applied at the Port of
                                            Rotterdam (Netherlands) - the gateway port of Europe. The digital twin is
                                            used to establish, monitor, operate transportation activities, and manage
                                            the infrastructure system based on data analysis of weather, geography,
                                            hydrographic conditions, which brings many benefits such as supporting port
                                            management and operation activities, optimizing the process of berthing ship
                                            movements, reducing waiting time for ships, saving costs, improving safety
                                            in port exploitation activities, predicting equipment maintenance times,
                                            etc. Applying Industry 4.0 technology to gradually digitize the
                                            infrastructure of Ba Ria - Vung Tau's seaports as a database, building a
                                            digital twin, and moving towards building a smart port is the optimal
                                            solution to realize the government's policy and the Ministry of Transport
                                            and the Vietnam Maritime Administration's direction to apply the
                                            achievements of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 to the management and
                                            operation of the seaport system. Therefore, the Maritime Administration of
                                            Vung Tau has
                                            worked with the Portcoast Consultant Corporation (Portcoast) to research and
                                            propose a "digitization" solution for Vung Tau

                                        <p>To implement this policy and solution, the Vung Tau Maritime Port Authority
                                            proactively provided Portcoast with information and data on the port (port
                                            construction design files, maritime traffic flow, detailed data on types of
                                            ships passing through Vung Tau port, maritime conditions in the area, etc.),

                                            docks in the management area. They collaborated with Portcoast to conduct
                                            surveys, gather necessary data, and organize work, mobilizing port companies
                                            operating in the cooperation area to provide data related to
                                            design/conversion/upgrading of port bridges, waterfront areas, etc., to
                                            ensure sufficient necessary data and create conditions for Portcoast to use
                                            Digital Twin - a "twin" of the physical environment in the digital space,
                                            such as a 3D model of the port or infrastructure project - data generated
                                            throughout the project life cycle from survey, design, construction to
                                            operation, exploitation, and maintenance. However, unlike static data
                                            models, the Digital Twin model is "alive," automatically collecting
                                            real-time data through sensors, cameras, connected via the Internet of

                                            and adaptable set of solutions for all terrain scale requirements. Based on
                                            collected data, the 3D modeling process of the construction from point
                                            clouds is performed in Autodesk Revit software and 3D laser scanner
                                            manufacturer support software. The digitized model is completed and applied
                                            to asset information management, building virtual port tour models, and most
                                            importantly, developing a digital twin.</p>
                                        <p>As the gateway and international container transshipment port, Vung Tau
                                            seaport plays a significant role in Vietnam's seaport system. Therefore,
                                            actively coordinating research and completing the initial digitization of
                                            the planning, management, and operation of the port has great significance
                                            in terms of technological application and practical needs. This will help
                                            state management agencies, investors, operators, and related businesses
                                            manage and operate the seaport more effectively. Digitization will maximize
                                            operational capacity, improve operational safety, minimize environmental
                                            impact, and integrate the port system into the development process of the
                                            global maritime transportation ecosystem. In the future, the digital model
                                            will allow the reproduction of what is happening in the port system,
                                            establish scenarios for simulating all port activities, such as traffic
                                            activities, and possible emergency situations. From there, developing
                                            response scenarios and moving towards a comprehensive seaport management
                                            system to meet the trend of smart port development in the Industry 4.0
                                            era... This is a great effort of Portcoast Company, as well as related
                                            agencies and units, and completing the "digitization of Vung Tau seaport"
                                            soon will be a prerequisite for evaluating effectiveness, drawing
                                            experience, and moving towards experimental application in important
                                            seaports nationwide.</p>
