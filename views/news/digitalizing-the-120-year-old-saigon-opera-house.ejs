                                        <p>Built in 1898 and operated in 1900, Saigon Opera House obtained a unique
                                            design that prevailed in the late nineteenth century. All decorative
                                            patterns, façade reliefs and interior designs were entirely inspired by the
                                            French architectural style. With its original architecture along with modern
                                            sound and lighting systems, the Theater is a place where every crucial
                                            domestic and overseas performing arts show takes place, gradually becoming
                                            one of the City’s top-picked tourist attractions.</p>

                                        <p>Over 21 years working at Saigon Opera House, Mr. Le Huu Luan – the former
                                            Director of the Center of the Performing and Cinema Organization, directly
                                            under the Department of Culture and Sports (the Theater management unit) -
                                            expressed his concerns towards any minor or major changes made to the
                                            theater. More to this, his concerns arose even more when the Metro Line was
                                            commenced operating 30 meters under the ground along with the severe fire of
                                            the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, France.</p>
                                        <p>Meanwhile, throughout over a century of operation, the Theater has inevitably
                                            degraded. In 2019, the building’s roofs developed long and serious cracks.
                                            Having acknowledged such dilapidations, Mr. Luan shared this to Mr. Pham Anh
                                            Tuan – the General Director of Portcoast Consultan Corporation. Upon
                                            receiving the information of preserving such historical and architectural
                                            values of the Theater, Mr. Tuan – an expert in the designing field - has
                                            made a promise to take on this tremendous responsibility. </p>
                                        <p>In September 2019, after many discussions and surveys, the team produced a
                                            solution to digitalize the Theater’s whole area and architecture. About 30
                                            engineers with more than a dozen laser scanners, geodetic measuring
                                            instruments divided themselves into groups of 5 to 7 people, then began
                                            conducting laser scanning at more than 350 scan stations, from the stage
                                            with the capacity of 400 seats to inaccessible areas such as the dome, the
                                            basement…</p>

                                        <p>Outside the building, the crane with a reach of 20 meters was used to take
                                            the engineers and the machines up, for the scanning of the entire roofs and
                                            the outer walls. Moreover, the upper-storey balconies of the nearby hotels
                                            such as Caravelle and Continetal Hotel were used to scan the entire
                                            building. </p>
                                        <p>At the end of the laser scanning procedure, the engineers digitalized and
                                            classified over 50 theater structural elements such as columns, roofs,
                                            purlins and bearing bars. In terms of the Theater’s architecture, the
                                            project team collected the data of 1,000 details comprising patterns,
                                            reliefs, statues, chandeliers,… in every corner of the theater, from the
                                            basement to the roof.</p>
                                        <p>By recording the information of the Theater’s current state, engineers are
                                            able to collect the most accurate data of even the smallest structures,
                                            details, patterns with the deviation ranging from 1 to 3 mm, compared to the
                                            actual size. The digitalized details reflect technical specifications about
                                            the length, width, thickness, construction materials, historical
                                            signifcance,… As for such minor details, the engineers have to set up
                                            various scanning stations in order to precisely determine the object’s
                                            shape.</p>
                                        <p>The final stage is transferring all the data into the computer-aided Building
                                            Information Modeling (BIM), allowing the history management of this 120-year
                                            Theater, even in the future. According to Dr. Hoang Hiep (the project
                                            leader), when it is necessary to reconstruct any parts and details, the
                                            Theater only needs to rely on the digitalized data. From that, the
                                            reconstruction phase is carried out by 3D printing the models, which will
                                            then be casted with high accuracy level, as close to the orginal. In early
                                            October, the digitalization project of the Theater was completed.</p>

                                        <p>Mr. Pham Anh Tuan kept the overall cost of this digitalization project a
                                            secret as he regarded this as an act of expressing his gratitude to not only
                                            his friend but also to the preservation of ancient works in the city. Soon,
                                            the team will transfer all theater data to the theater management unit and
                                            the Department of Culture and Sports. Besides, this digitalization project
                                            is also in commensurate with </p>
                                        <p>According to Architect Ngo Viet Nam Son, digitizing all ancient buildings to
                                            obtain current status drawings is necessary to manage and restore monuments
                                            and heritage when damaged. Some developed countries also apply the
                                            digitization of heritage because this model provides the highest accuracy of
                                            building information storage. However, the city should bid for digitization
                                            to choose technology that is reasonable and economical. </p>
                                        <p>Today, besides Saigon Opera House, the city has more than 150 ancient villas,
                                            including 100-year-old building with architectural, artistic and cultural
                                            values that need to be preserved as Headquarter of the City People’s
                                            Committee, City Post Office, The Notre Dame Cathedral, Ho Chi Minh City
                                            Museum of Fine Art, etc. </p>
                                        <p>In May, the City People’s Committee of Ho Chi Minh City classified the old
                                            villas into 3 groups 1,2, and 3 to facilitate the management and
                                            conservation. 52 villas in group 1 are strictly managed by the city
                                            government to keep the shape and architecture from outside to inside. About
                                            the villas in group 2, they need to keep the exterior architecture; group 3
                                            has to comply with the regulations on planning, architecture and
                                            construction legislation.</p>
                                        <p>According to the inspection conclusion of the Department of Construction, the
                                            villas of groups 1 and 2 cannot be demolished if they are not badly damaged
                                            or in danger of collapsing. In case of forced demolition to rebuild, the
                                            owner must comply with the original architecture, use the right materials,
