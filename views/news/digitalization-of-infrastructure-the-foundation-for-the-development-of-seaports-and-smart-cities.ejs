                                        <p>Today, we often hear about Industry 4.0, the digital age, or digital
                                            transformation. It's not just about communication, camera systems, or
                                            documents being converted to electronic form, but all areas and activities
                                            in life can integrate digital technology.</p>
                                        <p>As a leading consultancy in the port and maritime construction industry,
                                            Portcoast understands the need to apply the achievements of Industry 4.0 to
                                            quickly achieve the goal of digitalizing seaport infrastructure and moving
                                            towards building smart ports, which is an inevitable development trend.

                                        <p>For Vietnam, the government has set out strategies to make our country a
                                            strong maritime nation, including the task of developing the seaport system.
                                            Therefore, applying scientific and technological achievements to the seaport
                                            system that is suitable for the new development stage is the shortest path

                                        <p>In recent years, despite the explosive growth of Building Information
                                            Modeling (BIM) due to its many benefits, especially its application in
                                            creating Digital Twins, the technology has been slow to develop and faces
                                            many challenges in the Vietnamese maritime industry. Understanding the
                                            benefits, Portcoast has invested heavily in and researched BIM and
                                            Scan-to-BIM technologies, digitizing many ports towards the goal of
                                            consulting and developing Digital Twins for the maritime industry.</p>
                                        <p>In the past 2 years, Portcoast has digitized and researched the
                                            implementation of Digital Twins for many ports and port clusters in Vietnam
                                            and abroad, notably the Cai Mep - Thi Vai port cluster. The unique feature
                                            of the port is that it includes both onshore and underwater structures.
                                            Therefore, Portcoast uses both digital equipment for onshore and underwater
                                            structures.</p>
                                        <p>For the onshore area, we use 3D laser scanning devices placed on fixed
                                            stations (Terrestrial Laser Scanning) and on vehicles (Mobile mapping)
                                            integrated with GPS positioning system for simultaneous movement and
                                            scanning. Furthermore, another technology integrates 3D laser scanners and
                                            unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to scan data in large areas. The two devices
                                            that Portcoast uses come from famous brands such as Stormbee integrated with
                                            Faro S350-A scanner and DJI Matrice 300 RTK integrated with Zenmuse L1
                                            module.</p>
                                        <p>For the underwater area, Portcoast uses a mobile mapping solution on an
                                            unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The devices mounted on the USV include a 3D
                                            laser scanner (NORBIT iLidar) placed on the bow of the ship to record
                                            surrounding data, and a device mounted on the bottom of the ship (NORBIT
                                            iWBMS) to scan the seabed topography and riverbed.</p>
                                        <p>With the application of current technology and equipment, Portcoast can
                                            create an accurate digital model of a port or port system with complete
                                            information, like a twin sibling to the actual construction, serving
                                            management and operation.

                                        <p>Is it because of Portcoast's technological and experiential potential in
                                            implementing digital projects that they continue to advance and research the
                                            application of these modern technology processes to urban infrastructure?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>That's right. Imagine we have a small-scale map of the entire city, we can
                                            already have an overview of the urban space development plan to consider
                                            development directions. So now we have a digital model at a 1:1 scale,
                                            representing the entire above and underground infrastructure with full
                                            information, what can we do? This digital model of the entire city not only
                                            allows us to study urban development planning, clearly see the underground
                                            technical infrastructure system, and related information on management,
                                            maintenance, and repairs but also allows us to reproduce what is happening
                                            in the city, establish scenarios simulating all activities in the city such
                                            as traffic activities, potential incidents that may occur... to build
                                            response scenarios and move towards comprehensive city management systems.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Therefore, to have a smart city, we need to build a digital model, which can
                                            start from a neighborhood, an area, and then move on to the entire city. Ho
                                            Chi Minh City was chosen by Portcoast as the city to implement the pilot
                                            project, using modern equipment as mentioned above to scan data of cultural
                                            heritage or iconic architecture such as the Municipal Theatre, Independence
                                            Palace, City Hall, Bitexco, Vietcombank Tower... or to scan data of streets
                                            and sidewalks on both sides.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Currently, some specific projects such as the City Theater and the
                                            surrounding roads, and the Vietcombank Tower have been digitally modeled by
                                            us. We hope to soon deploy mobile mapping applications to scan data for

                                                surrounding roads, and the Vietcombank Tower have been digitally modeled
                                                by us. We hope to soon deploy mobile mapping applications to scan data
                                                for streets.
                                                Therefore, Portcoast owns a comprehensive and ready-made solution for
                                                large-scale projects. What is Portcoast's goal for the future?</i></p>
                                        <p>With significant developments and notable achievements in the past, Portcoast
                                            is aiming for even more ambitious goals in the future. Specifically,
                                            Portcoast aims to complete the digitization of the entire Thi Vai-Cai Mep
                                            port system in 2021.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, a complete and modern solution system has been developed for the
                                            purpose of collecting data to serve the urban infrastructure digitization
                                            process in Vietnam. In terms of modernity, this system is currently on par
                                            with the world and ready for the urban digitization process. Specifically,
                                            Portcoast aims to complete the digitization of some areas in Ho Chi Minh
                                            City.</p>
                                        <p>For example, in the case of Covid-19 prevention and control, assuming we have
                                            a complete digital model of the entire city, combined with an AI
                                            identification system and real-time data, we can manage traffic flows to
                                            limit overcrowding in a specific location or area on a virtual 1:1 scale.
