                            <p>Building information modeling is built on a foundation that enables seamless
                                collaboration
                                circuit and efficiency among AEC specialists by coordinating their work on
                                a digital BIM information model. 3D BIM model containing all relevant information
                                to the construction project can be used throughout the life of the project, which all
                                All members involved can easily and remotely access. BIM allows architects, engineers
                                and
                                Other construction professionals modify and update 3D BIM models in real time, ensuring
                                Make sure everyone has access to the updated model.
                            </p>
                            <p>Portcoast Digital Transformation Center is a BIM service provider that provides
                                project design from start to finish. Our BIM Services include Architectural BIM, Structural BIM, MEP BIM Modeling, BIM Coordination, Clash Detection, Scan to BIM,...</p>

                            <ul class="pcc-list">
                                <li><strong>Increased Collaboration:</strong><br>BIM used in a project will increase
                                    strengthen cooperation between different groups and sectors. It supports design validation,
                                    communicate and allow for quick error resolution</li>
                                <li><strong>Overall construction cost savings:</strong><br>BIM helps to create building data and geometrical model before the actual construction begins which avoids redundant construction, on-site errors and delay in construction.</li>
                                <li><strong>Performance of Building Infrastructure:</strong><br>BIM helps model development
                                    information-rich buildings that can be used to increase building performance after construction
                                    build</li>
                                <li><strong>Easy project implementation:</strong><br>Design validation in BIM Model is completed
                                    completed during the design phase, which makes design validation easier
                                    faster and easier</li>
